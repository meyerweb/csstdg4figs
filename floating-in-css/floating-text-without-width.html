So we browsed the shops, buying here and there, but browsing at least every other store. The street vendors were less abundant, but <em>much</em> more persistent, which was sort of funny. Kat was fun to watch, too, as she haggled with various sellers. I don't think we paid more than two-thirds the original asking price on anything!

Of course, we found out later just how badly we'd done. But hey, that's what tourists are for.

All of our buying was done in shops on the outskirts of the market area. The main section of the market was actually sort of a letdown, being more expensive, more touristy, and less friendly, in a way. About this time I started to wear down, so we caught a taxi back to the New Otani.
